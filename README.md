## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a complete redesign of the Ryze website (get-ryze.ai) with improved visual appeal, user experience, and clarity of communication. The design is modern, clean, and professional while maintaining the core messaging about Ryze's AI-powered advertising platform.

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Visual Design
- **Color Palette**: Primary blue (#0ea5e9) and accent purple (#d946ef) gradients create a modern, tech-forward aesthetic
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean, readable text with clear hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace and consistent padding create a breathable, professional layout
- **Animations**: Subtle Framer Motion animations enhance user engagement without being distracting

### User Experience
- **Clear Navigation**: Fixed header with smooth scroll navigation and mobile-responsive hamburger menu
- **Strong CTAs**: Prominent "Get Started" buttons with hover effects guide users to conversion
- **Information Hierarchy**: Clear section separation with gradient backgrounds and consistent spacing
- **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive design that works seamlessly on all device sizes

### Modular Structure
The website is organized into reusable, modular components:

- **Header** (`components/Header.tsx`): Fixed navigation with mobile menu
- **Hero** (`components/Hero.tsx`): Eye-catching landing section with value proposition
- **Stats** (`components/Stats.tsx`): Social proof with key metrics
- **Features** (`components/Features.tsx`): Grid layout showcasing platform capabilities
- **Testimonials** (`components/Testimonials.tsx`): Customer testimonials with ratings
- **CTA** (`components/CTA.tsx`): Conversion-focused call-to-action section
- **Footer** (`components/Footer.tsx`): Comprehensive footer with links and social media

Each component is:
- Self-contained and reusable
- Easily customizable
- Accessible (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Mobile-responsive

## 📱 Pages
